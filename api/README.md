# ATMBranchFinder

'grabATMs.js' and 'grabBranches.js' populate the 'ATMListings' and 'BranchListings' folders.
The above is required for 'getMarkers.js' to work as a REST API.

In the 'demo' folder there are two HTML documents that make some example calls to the API assuming the server is being hosted on localhost.
